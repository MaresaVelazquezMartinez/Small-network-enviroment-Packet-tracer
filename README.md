# Small-network-enviroment-Packet-tracer
This project simulates a small enterprise network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed to demonstrate VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP services, and dynamic routing using OSPF across both LAN and WAN segments.

The goal of this project is to practice designing, configuring, and verifying connectivity in a multi-VLAN, multi-router environment.
